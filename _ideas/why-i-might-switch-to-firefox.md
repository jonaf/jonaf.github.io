title: Why I might switch back to Firefox
---

I've been on the hunt for a replacement for Chrome, since it has grown far too much for my hackerish tastes. I switched to Chrome from Firefox for the same reason -- bloat, slowness, plugins (I don't need your plugins!), et cetera. In fact, I miss the days when Firefox was called Firebird[1]. Those were the days...

But enough about the past. There's a new kid in town. His name's Servo.

Servo is written in Rust[2]. That's awesome because Rust is awesome, for all the reasons, as well as fast, and it's a language I've been keeping my eyes on for about a year now. I was actually going to write a browser from scratch in Rust, but when I did a quick check to see if someone got started before me (as folks often do), I came across Servo.

So, why am I talking about Firefox? Because, one of the long term goals[3] of Servo is to incrementally replace components of Firefox. Which is pretty awesome.

However, for the minimalist hacker like yours truly, Servo will live on independent of Servo. So, excepting the whole plugin situation, I can eat my cake and have it, too.

One thing that I've been lamenting of late is that it's hard to use the Internet for its intended purpose: information. There's so many flashy bells and whistles, ads and interstitials, banners and links, photos and...did I mention ads? Oh, and also, JavaScript. Man, I'm tired of JavaScript. It's worse now than it was with pop-ups in the '90s. Can we get back to basics?

I want to use / fork Servo in such a way that I can browse the web and get its *semantic* value, without all the additions. For most people, maybe this is too minimalist or too much effort to get going. For me, I just want to read the body of your content, like a search engine or something would. Someone once said, "Content is King."[4] They're right.
